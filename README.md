### Project Description
Decision Helper is a frontend-only web application that helps users make decisions by comparing multiple options based on factors that matter to them. Users can select a category, add options, define factors, rate each option, and get the best recommendation – all in a simple and interactive interface.

### The Problem statement
Many people struggle to make decisions when faced with multiple options and conflicting factors. Manual comparison can be time-consuming and confusing, leading to suboptimal choices. Decision Helper aims to simplify this process by providing an interactive, frontend-only web application that helps users evaluate options based on personalized factors and ratings, enabling them to make informed decisions quickly and confidently.

### The Solution
We are solving the problem by building a simple, interactive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add options, define important factors, rate each option, and get a recommended choice based on their ratings. This helps users make decisions quickly and confidently without confusion.
